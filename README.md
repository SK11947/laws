# Liberland Laws

Welcome to the Liberland Laws repository! Here, we store drafted (interim) Laws and draft new Laws. Note: Interim Laws mean Laws which are adopted by the Cabinet rather than the (as of yet non-existent) Referendum.

We draft in Google Docs and when a milestone is reached, a folder will be made in this repo and a Markdown version of the draft placed there. Adopting as an interim law shall be the last milestone for the time being, until a revision or the final adoption by the Referendum.

Please open a draft from the list below to access the draft of a proposed Law. To add your recommendation, please either open and Issue or simply make an open pull request with the requested review. You can open an [Issue](https://github.com/liberland/laws/issues) to let us know what the problem is.

Please go to the [discussions](https://github.com/liberland/laws/discussions) and let's start the discussion about your proposal, before or after you make it. To see the big picture of the drafting, please go to [projects](https://github.com/liberland/laws/projects?type=new).

If you want to contribute, please give us (justice@liberland.org) your GitHub handle to be added to this repo!
