# Real Estate Law

## Preface

This Law governs the Real Estate in Liberland, its transfer, the mandatory registration of Real Estate, the initial land ownership, zoning and the Land Fee.

## Definitions

**Ownership** is a constitutional right of an individual towards their own body, their actions or things. It is a bundle of rights which are usually not severed, but could be severable if the Owner so desires. Those rights include and are not limited to:

-   Possession;

-   Right to Modify;

-   Right to Destroy/Degrade;

-   Right to Relinquish;

-   Right to Transfer Use;

-   Right to Transfer the Obtainment of Produce (usufruct).

**Land Fee** is an institute required by the Constitution whereby holders of real estate in Liberland are mandated annually to pay a certain amount. The sole purpose of the Land Fee is to be the source of revenue for the administration on which it can always fall back, by which to cover its mandatory expenses.

**Soil** is the upper unconsolidated and fertile layer of the Earth's crust which has formed under the effect of natural processes and human activities and which consists of mineral and organic material, liquids and gaseous substances;

**Soil Degradation** signifies changes which have occurred or are taking place under the impact of natural processes or human activities and due to which the possibility of using soil in the implementation of economic, environmental protection, and cultural functions is decreasing;

**Soil Recultivation** is a set of measures which promotes the restoration of fertility of soil;

**A Degraded Territory** shall be a territory with a destroyed or damaged upper layer of ground or an abandoned territory of construction, extraction of mineral resources, or economic or military activities;

**Inland Public Waters** are the public lakes and rivers indicated in Annex I to this Law;

**Vacant Unit of Land** shall be land free of structures or on which only such structures are located which are not by Law to be recorded in the Land Registry.

**Land Protection** shall be the measures for preventing land degradation and degradation risk and preserving the useful properties of land.

**Land Degradation** is the reduction or disappearance of land and the economic or ecological value of the resources related to it as a result of action or failure to act of a human being or as a result of natural processes.

## Section 1: Real Estate

#### Art. 1: Real Estate

This Law shall govern the ownership, development, destruction and preservation of Real Estate, which shall be 

a) the land within the State jurisdiction of Liberland; and 

b) any other property built on the land or connected to it in ways which preclude separating it from the land without incurring excessive costs.

#### Art. 2: Purpose of the Law

The purpose of this Law shall be to 

a) protect the land and allow regular development on it; and also 

b) to regulate the ownership rights to Real Estate so that this area of human activity becomes transparent and easy to access to a non-expert.

#### Art. 3: Superficies Solo Coedit

Unless stipulated otherwise by the owner, the owner of land or the holder of other rights towards it shall also be the owner of or the holder of these other rights towards the immovable property built on that land or permanently connected to it.

## Section 2: Real Estate Rights

#### Art. 3: Real Estate Rights

§ 1

Real Estate Rights shall be any rights which pertain to a piece or pieces of Real Estate. They shall be 

a) Real Rights, which attach to the given Real Estate and are retained by it even when ownership changes; and 

b) Personal Rights, which attach to the given owner and aren't retained by the Real Estate where ownership changes.

§ 2

The list of rights in this Law is demonstrative, and Owners shall be able to construe their own rights; where these new rights bear any similarity to either a Real Right or a Personal Right, the new right shall retain the Real Right or Personal Right nature of the right closest in similarity to it.

#### Art. 4: Ownership

Ownership shall be the full Property to the given piece of Real Estate. Ownership in Real Estate shall be the same as ownership in any other thing, but its transfer shall be limited to the forms permitted in this Law.

#### Art. 5: Use

Use shall entail the ability to inhabit or otherwise use any the property, any of its parts or functions. The Use in question can be full, or the Owner can separate the property and allot the Uses to different persons..

#### Art. 6: Pledge

1) Pledge places a possessory title upon the Real Estate owed by a debtor to a creditor as a collateral to another debt. Where the debtor can't pay their original debt, the creditor shall be allowed to demand the sale of the Real Estate under Pledge in order to have the debt repaid. 

2) Where the parties don't stipulate otherwise, the risk of the sale of the Pledged Real Estate is born by the creditor; the successful sale under reasonable market conditions and circumstances replaces the repayment of the debt, even if the proceeds from the sale wouldn't satisfy the nominal value of the debt; where the proceeds are greater than the nominal value of the debt, the overvalue shall be retained by the debtor.

#### Art. 7: Usufruct

Usufruct shall be the right provided by the user to the tenant, typically for regular payment, to enjoy the use and advantages of another's property short of the destruction or waste of its substance. The produce as may be expected by reasonable use of the property shall be retained by the tenant.

#### Art. 8: Mortgage

A Mortgage shall be an agreement between an owner of Real Estate or a prospective buyer of Real Estate and a lender regarding a loan between them that gives the lender the right to take the property if the debtor fails to repay the loan.

#### Art.9: Habitation

1) A Habitation shall be the right of a tenant given by the Owner to regularly inhabit the piece of Real Estate, typically a home or a space suited for living. In the absence of further stipulation, they shall be allowed to inhabit the premises with their immediate family, but not with pets and they shall be prohibited from bringing in any harmful substances. 

2) A Habitation given in exchange for a counter payment shall be called a Lease.

#### Art. 10: Predial Servitude

## Section 5: Initial Land Ownership

#### Art. 1: Initial Land Ownership

The Provisional Government of Liberland has ensured that the land may be legally used by freeing it from its status as a terra nullius that prevented most forms of useful activity internationally. As a result, the Provisional Government of Liberland has mixed its labour with the entirety of the land of Gornja Siga. As per Liberland's Founding on the 13th of March 2015, until the date this Law gains legal force, the entirety of the land is and has been since owned by Liberland.

#### Art. 2: Retention of Land

Given how scarce land is as a resource, its extreme usefulness and the potential for disaster given the possible wrong use of that land, Liberland shall retain the ownership of the entirety of the land in Liberland for an indeterminate time.

#### Art. 3: Land Sale

1) It is not in the nature of a Libertarian State to own all the land on its territory. Liberland shall, through its Administration, ensure that the greater portion of the land is sold for a price and under conditions favourable to the Budget and the Treasury of the Administration. 

2) This land sale shall proceed as if Liberland was a private owner seeking to sell its land for the greatest profit.

#### Art. 4: Land Distribution

§ 1

1) The duty to sell the land shall not preclude Liberland from 

a) honouring its promises or obligations made during the time it hasn't had full control over the land; or 

b) extraordinarily, from awarding portions of the land to parties instrumental in Liberland gaining full control over the land. 

2) This Land Distribution may be realized as a gift or sale under conditions other than those of the market.

§ 2

1) Land Distribution proposals shall be a special case of a Budget proposal and shall follow the constitutional and legal rules for Budget Proposals with the exceptions outlined in this Law. 

2) The Enactment Period for Land Distribution proposals shall be no less than two months.

§ 3

1) The Minister of Interior shall draft any proposals for Land Distribution, which need to be countersigned by the President to be submitted to Congress. 

2) Congress shall decide upon Land Distribution Proposals. The passing of a Land Distribution Proposal shall require the ⅔ majority vote of all the Members of Congress to pass. 

3) As with any Budget proposals, the Senate shall be the final arbiter of whether or not the Land Distribution Proposals shall be realized.

4) The Public Veto shall be allowed to cancel any Land Distribution proposals during its Enactment Period. 

§ 4

1) Under no circumstances shall more than 25 % of the total land area be subjected to Land Distribution, even should that mean that certain previous promises shall not be honoured and obligations remain unfulfilled.  

2) Where there is a need to decide which of the previous promises should be honoured, the earlier promises shall take precedence over the latter promises, but the President shall have, with the approval of the Senate, the right ad hoc to deviate from this rule.

3) Those damaged by this provision shall be given recourse in movable property and, where possible, in money.

4) Any amendment of this provision shall require the standard supermajority tally in the Referendum for the motion to pass, no matter the origin of the Referendum proposal.

#### Art. 5: Retention of Land

Liberland shall be allowed to retain a portion of the land no greater than 15 percent of the total area for its purposes. It shall, wherever possible, put the land to profitable economic use, but where impossible, it shall ensure that the development of the land benefits the greatest number of Liberlanders.

## Section 6: Zoning

#### Art. 6: Zoning

§ 1

1) Upon its incorporation while all the land is owned by Liberland, the Minister of Interior shall without delay set up a zoning system. The Congress shall vote on this system by simple majority vote.

2) The zoning system shall entail a series of documents and maps describing in detail the intended use of the various pieces of land.

§ 2

No Land Sale or Land Distribution shall take place unless the given land has been zoned.

#### Art. 7: Retention of Zoning

§ 1

Any transfer of property into private hands shall be made with the reservation that the State retains the following rights to the land and to any future Real Estate built on that land:

§ 2

a) the property shall be used only in ways in which it or the underlying land parcel has been zoned for;

b) this restriction shall be retained even where future transfers between private owners take place and shall exist unto perpetuity.

§ 3

The State retains the right to change the zoning later on. This can be done unilaterally, to fulfil the purposes of this Law or the purposes of the Administration, or upon request of the owner or of interested parties with the express written consent of all the owners.

1.

#### Art. 7: Sanctions

§ 1

Where the Ministry of Interior finds that a land is not used in line with the Zoning, they shall be able to make a case before the Judiciary. The Judiciary shall use remedies of:

a) suspension of Citizenship rights;

b) monetary fine, issuable repeatedly, to the maximum of five percent of the market value of the property ; and, ultimately;

c) enforced sale of the property for market conditions; the proceeds minus the costs of the sale will go to the sanctioned owner.

## Section 7: Land Fee.

#### Art. 8: Land Fee

1) Along with the zoning plan, the Minister of Interior shall also set up the system according to which the duty to pay the Land Fee shall be determined. This system shall be enshrined by a Law which the Congress shall propose for a Referendum.

#### Art. 9: Regular Review

The Minister of Interior shall regularly review the Land Fee rules, ensuriing that they follow the current market conditions. The Minister of Interior shall annually submit draft amendments for the Congress to propose for Referendum.

## Section 8: Final Provisions

#### Art. 10: Legal Force

This Law takes legal force at the end of a standard Enactment Period following its adoption in the Referendum.
