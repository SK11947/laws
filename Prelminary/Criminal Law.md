# Book 1: General Part

## Section 1: Principles of Criminal Law

#### Art. 1: Criminal Offenses

§ 1

Criminal Offenses shall be those Delicts which, when committed, seriously impair their victims in their life, human dignity or property. The possibility of these acts being committed objectively increases the fear and uncertainty in life amongst rationally acting persons. A rational actor would take significant and costly steps to prevent these acts from being visited on themselves or others.

§ 2

Criminal Offenses shall be the most serious category of Delicts in Liberland and for them alone shall be prescribed Criminal Sanctions, the most impactful amongst all the Sanctions which Liberland can prescribe. 

§ 3

All Criminal Offenses shall be enumerated in the Book 2 of this Law, and no Delict shall be a Criminal Offense in Liberland except that it should be listed in this Book. The enitre material Criminal Law of Liberland shall be contained in this Law and no special Laws regarding criminal matters shall be drafted.

§ 4

1) As with any other Delict, no action shall be recognized as a Criminal Offense where there is no victim, by which is meant a natural or a moral Person who has incurred specific damage as the direct or indirect consequences of the Criminal Offense being committed. 

2) The damage doesn't have to be enumerated in money or even liable for such enumeration, but it must be demonstrated and supported by evidence. If in doubt, the benefit of the purported victim shall take precedence before the benefit of the perpetrator or the State.

3) Specifically for Criminal Offenses, damage visited upon Natural Persons shall be considered more serious than damage visited upon Moral Persons.

#### Art. 2: Criminal Sanctions

§ 1

Criminal Sanctions shall be prescribed only for acts threatening or violating life, human dignity or private property and personal liberties or human rights, as well as other rights and social values guaranteed and protected by the Constitution of Liberland and international law in such a manner that their protection could not be realized without criminal law enforcement.

§ 2

1) The general purpose of prescribing, pronouncing or applying criminal sanctions is that all citizens honor the legal system and that no one commits a criminal offense, and that perpetrators of criminal offenses do not continue acting in a similar way in the future. 

2) The prescribing of specific criminal offences, as well as the types and the range of criminal sanctions against their perpetrators, shall be based upon the necessity for Criminal Law enforcement and its proportionality with the degree and nature of the danger against life, human dignity or private property. 

3) In determining the contents of criminal sanctions and the manner of their application, the freedoms and rights of the Perpetrator of a Criminal Offense may be limited only to a degree corresponding to the type of the criminal sanction applied and its special purpose determined by Law, without causing corporal pain or mental suffering, inhuman or degrading treatment, while observing human dignity and personality.

§ 3

1) No Criminal Sanction shall be prescribed if the act in question was no Criminal Offense at the time it was committed.

2) The Criminal Law in force at the time the act was committed shall be applied to the perpetrator of a Criminal Offense.

3) If the Criminal Law changes after the act was commited and the Law at the time of the Criminal Proceedings has become more lenient for the purported Perpetrator, the Law as applies at the time of the Criminal Proceedings shall apply.

§ 4

The provisions of the preceeding paragraph shall not apply to the crimes of Genocide, Ethnic Cleansing and War Crimes, as all human beings should know the wrongness of those acts. For those special Criminal Offenses, the Criminal Law in force when the Criminal Process takes place shall be applied and they shall be liable for prosecution even if not seen as criminal in the time and place they were commited. 

#### Art. 3: Time of Perpetration of a Criminal Offense

A criminal offense is committed at the time the perpetrator acts or ought to have acted, irrespective of the time when the consequence, which is a material element of the criminal offense, occurs. 

#### Art. 4: Place of Perpetration of a Criminal Offense

1) A criminal offense is committed both at the place the perpetrator acts or ought to have acted, and at the place where the consequence, which is a material element of a criminal offense, fully or partially occurs or, in the case of a punishable attempt, ought to have occurred according to the perpetrator's expectation.

2) In the cases of complicity, the criminal offense is committed at the place specified as it would be for the main Perpetrator and at the place the accomplice acts or ought to have acted, or at the place where the consequence, which is a material element of a criminal offense, ought to have occurred according to the expectation of the accomplice. 

#### Art. 5: Culpability

No one shall be punished if not found culpable of the committed offense, whether by Malintent or by Gross Negligence.

#### Art. 6: Omission 

1) A criminal offense is committed by omission when the perpetrator, who is legally obligated to avert the consequence of a criminal offense defined by law, fails to do so, and such a failure to act is tantamount in its effect and significance to the perpetration of such an offense by an act. 

2) The punishment of a perpetrator who commits a criminal offense by omission can be mitigated, except in the case of a criminal offense which can be committed only by failure to act. 

#### Art. 7: Types of Criminal Sanctions

1) The following shall be Criminal Sanctions in Liberland: 

a) punishments, 

b) non-custodial sanctions (judicial admonition and suspended sentences), 

c) security measures; and 

d) educational measures.

2) The duration of any type of criminal sanction shall be determined by statute and no criminal sanction shall be prescribed, pronounced or applied for an indefinite time.

#### Art. 8: Right to Rehabilitation

A Perpetrator sentenced for a Criminal Offense, after certain amount of time passes or where their sentence should be rescinded, shall be deemed a person who has not committed a criminal offense. Their rights and liberties shall not differ from the rights and liberties of persons who have not committed a Criminal Offense. 

#### Art. 9: Territorial and Ex-Territorial Applicability

1) This Law shall apply to anyone who commits a Criminal Offense within its territory.

#### Art. 10: Personal Applicability

1) This Law shall be applied to a Liberland Citizen who, outside the territory of Liberland, commits a criminal offense.

2) This Law shall be applied to an alien who, outside the territory of Liberland, commits a criminal offense against Liberland.

Criminal legislation shall not be applied to a young person who, at the time of committing a criminal offense, had not reached fourteen years of age. 

#### Art. 12: Deprivation of Liberty in a Foreign Country

In the cases of the application of a Criminal Sanction after the perpetrator has already been deprived of his liberty in a foreign state due to a Criminal Offense, the time spent in pre-trial detention or imprisonment, or any other deprivation of liberty, shall be included in the sentence pronounced by the domestic court for the same Criminal Offense, and if the sentences are not of the same type, the inclusion shall be made in accordance with an equitable assessment of the court. 

#### Art. 13: Statute of Limitation

§ 1

Criminal Sanctions may not be applied after the period determined by this Code for the given Criminal Sanction and a Criminal Offense has elapsed from the time the Criminal Offense has been committed, the punishment pronounced or other criminal sanction ordered.

2) If, for a single criminal offense, several punishments are prescribed, the period of limitation shall be applied according to the most severe punishment prescribed for such an offense. 

§ 3

There shall be no Statute of Limitation for the crimes of Genocide, Ethnic Cleansing and for War Crimes. The Natural Person shall be prosecutable until their death and they might be pronounced guilty even after that (without consequences for their posterity), where a Moral Person shall be prosecutable even if it disolves, where it has any clear successor or successors.

§ 1

1) The period prescribed by the Statute of Limitation to institute criminal prosecution commences on the date the Criminal Offense was committed.

#### Art. 16: Self-Defense

1) There shall be no criminal offense when the perpetrator acts in self-defense. 

2) Self-defense is a defense which is absolutely necessary for the perpetrator to avert an imminent or immediate unlawful attack on him or on another person.

#### Art. 17: Necessity

§ 2

1) The perpetrator is not culpable if he has committed an illegal act in order to avert from himself or from another an imminent danger which could not have been averted in any other way, provided that in doing so the harm that is done is not disproportionally greater than that which had been threatened. 

2) If, in this case, the perpetrator was avoidably mistaken about the circumstances which exclude culpability, he shall be punished for negligence if, for the committed offense, the Code prescribes punishment for negligence. 

§ 3

The defense of necessity is not available if the perpetrator was obligated to expose himself to danger. 

#### Art. 18: Coercion or Threat

1) There shall be no criminal offense when the perpetrator acts under the influence of irresistible coercion.

#### Art. 20: Attempt

1) Whoever intentionally commences to execute a criminal offense but does not consummate it shall be punished for the attempt only of a Criminal Offense for which a punishment of five years of imprisonment or a more serious penalty is prescribed by law, while the attempt of another criminal offense is punishable only if the law expressly provides for the punishment for an attempt. 

2) The Perpetrator who attempts to commit a Criminal Offense shall be punished as if the offense had been completed, but the punishment can also be mitigated. 

3) If the perpetrator attempts to commit a Criminal Offense by means that are inappropriate to accomplish the ends sought, or against an object upon which a Criminal Offense could not have been committed, the court may remit the punishment.

A perpetrator who, due to the consumption of alcohol, narcotic drugs or other substances, culpably brings himself into a state in which he is incapable of understanding the significance of his conduct or of controlling his own will shall not be deemed mentally incapable if, at the time of bringing himself into such a state, his intent encompasses the offense committed, or if at this time he is negligent in regard to the offense, provided that the statute prescribes punishment for such a form of culpability as well. 

#### Art. 28: Diminished Mental Capacity

The punishment of a perpetrator may be mitigated if at the time of the perpetration of a criminal offense, due to a condition referred to in Article 40, paragraph 2 of this Code, the perpetrator was of Criminal Code 11 substantially diminished mental capacity, provided that the mental deficiency was not voluntarily produced.

#### Art. 33: Mistake of Fact

1) A perpetrator does not act intentionally if at the time of the perpetration of a criminal offense he is not aware of one of its material elements.

## Section 3: Punishment and Sentencing

#### Art. 34: Types of Punishment

1) Perpetrators of criminal offenses may be punished by fine or imprisonment. 

2) Imprisonment shall be imposed only as the principal punishment. 

3) A fine may be imposed both as the principal and a supplementary punishment. 

4) For criminal offenses committed for personal gain, a fine may be imposed as a supplementary punishment, even when it is not prescribed by law, or when the law prescribes that the perpetrator is to be punished by imprisonment or by a fine, while the court pronounces imprisonment as the principal punishment.

#### Art. 35: The Purpose of Punishment

By taking into consideration the general purpose of criminal sanctions, the purpose of inflicting punishment is to 

a) effect compensation for the victims;

b) deter the perpetrator from committing criminal offenses in the future,

c) deter all others from committing criminal offenses,

d) express the community's condemnation of a committed criminal offense; and 

e) by the implementation of statutory punishments to increase the consciousness of citizens of the danger of criminal offenses and of the fairness of punishing perpetrators. 

#### Art. 36: Fine

1) A fine shall be imposed according to daily income. It amounts to at least ten and not more than three hundred daily incomes, except for criminal offences committed for personal gain when the maximum fine may amount to five hundred daily incomes. 

2) The court shall determine the number of daily incomes on the basis of Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances as listed in this Law other than those relating to the financial situation of the perpetrator. 

3) When determining the amount of a daily income, the court shall take into account the perpetrator's total income, their property and his family obligations. If the perpetrator of a criminal offense does not have any income but is the owner of property or property rights, the court shall determine the daily income by a free estimate following the value of such property or property rights

#### Art. 37: Substitution of Fine

1) The fine shall not be collected by force. 

2) When the fine is not paid in full or in part within the period determined in the judgment, the court shall, without delay, bring a decision to substitute the fine by imprisonment. 

3) The fine shall be substituted by imprisonment in such a way that one daily income is substituted by one day of imprisonment, with the proviso that the maximum duration of imprisonment, substituting the fine, shall not exceed twelve months. 

4) If the convict pays a part of the fine, the duration of imprisonment shall be reduced proportionally, and if he pays the fine in full, the execution of the penalty of imprisonment shall be suspended. 

#### Art. 38: Imprisonment

1) Imprisonment may not be shorter than thirty days or longer than twenty years. 

2) Life imprisonment may be prescribed for the most serious criminal offences (hereinafter: life sentence). 

3) Long-term imprisonment shall never be the sole punishment for a specific criminal offence. 

4) Long-term imprisonment shall not be imposed on a perpetrator who, at the time of the perpetration of the criminal offence, has not reached the age of twenty-one years. 

5) The imprisonment of juveniles shall be imposed under the conditions prescribed by a special statute on young perpetrators of criminal offences. The imprisonment of juveniles is, in its purpose, nature, duration and manner of execution, a special penalty of deprivation of liberty. 

6) When imprisonment without a minimum duration and with a maximum duration of three years is prescribed for a criminal offence, together with such a penalty, a fine shall be prescribed as an alternative punishment. 

7) Imprisonment shall be assessed and imposed in full years and months and in full days if its duration is up to three months. 

#### Art. 39: Community Service

1) When the court assesses and imposes imprisonment for the duration of up to six months, it may at the same time decide that such punishment, with the convict's consent, be replaced with community service.

2) The decision to replace imprisonment with community service shall be based upon the assessment that, considering all the circumstances determining the type and range of the sentence, the execution of imprisonment would not be necessary to realise the purpose of punishment, and (at the same time) a non-custodial measure would not be sufficient to accomplish the general purpose of criminal sanctions. 

3) Community service shall be determined for a duration proportional to the imposed imprisonment, from a minimum of ten to a maximum of sixty working days. The period for performing community service shall neither be shorter than one month nor longer than one year. 

4) In assessing the duration of community service, as well as the period for its performance, the court shall take into consideration the pronounced imprisonment which is being substituted and the perpetrator's possibilities regarding personal circumstances and employment. 

5) When the convict has not completed or has only partly completed the community service upon the expiry of the determined period, the court shall decide on the execution of imprisonment for a period proportional to the unfulfilled community service. 

6) The replacement of imprisonment with community service may also be applied in the case of substituting a fine with imprisonment, when such imprisonment does not exceed six months.

#### Art. 40 Parole

1) A convict may be released form the institution after having served at least one-half of the term or, exceptionally, after having served one-third of the term to which he has been sentenced, under the conditions stated in this Law. 

2) A convict serving life sentence may be conditionally released if he has served twenty years of imprisonment. Any deprivation of liberty resulting from the perpetration of a criminal offense is considered to be a served sentence. 

3) A conditional release shall last until the day the pronounced sentence has expired and in the case of a convict serving life imprisonment, fifteen years from the day the conditional release has begun. 

4) If the convict, while on conditional release, commits one or more criminal offenses for which he is sentenced to imprisonment of six months or to a more severe sentence, the court which has pronounced the sentence shall revoke the conditional release and, by applying the provisions of Article 60 of this Code, pronounce an aggregate sentence which will include the part of the sentence the convict has already served. 

5) The court may also proceed in the way described in the previous paragraph when pronouncing a sentence of imprisonment shorter than six months. If the court does not revoke the conditional release, it shall be extended for the time the convict has spent serving the sentence of imprisonment. 

6) The conditional release may not be revoked if two years have passed from the expiry of the periods specified in paragraph 3 of this Article. 

7) Placement in community service (the type and the place of work) shall be made by the agency to execute criminal sanctions, taking into consideration the capacities and the skills of the convicted person.

#### Art. 41: General Rule for the Selection of the Type and Range of Punishment

In determining the type and range of punishment within limits established by this law for the committed criminal offence, the court, bearing in mind the purpose of punishment, shall take into consideration all the circumstances which result in less or more serious punishment for the perpetrator of a criminal offence (the mitigating or aggravating circumstances) and in particular the following: 

a) the degree of culpability,

b) motives for committing the criminal offence, 

c) the degree of peril or injury to the protected good, 

d) the circumstances under which the criminal offence was committed, 

e) the conditions in which the perpetrator had lived before committing the criminal offence,

d) their abidance by the laws, 

e) the circumstances they live in;

f) their conduct after the perpetration of the criminal offence, particularly his relation towards the injured person and 

g) their efforts to compensate for the damage caused by the criminal offence, and

h) the totality of social and personal grounds contributed to the perpetration of the criminal offence. 

#### Art. 42: Mitigation of Punishment

1) The punishment prescribed by law for a criminal offence may be mitigated when the statute expressly defines so or when the court holds that, given the existence of particularly obvious mitigating circumstances, the purpose of punishment may also be attained by a more lenient punishment. 

2) The limits of mitigation are the following: 

a) if, for a criminal offence, imprisonment for a maximum of three years or less is prescribed, regardless of the minimum duration, a fine may be imposed instead of imprisonment; 

b) if for a criminal offence, a minimum duration of imprisonment of one year or less, and a maximum of three years or more, is prescribed, the sentence may be reduced to the legal minimum of imprisonment; 

c) if for a criminal offence, imprisonment for at least two years is prescribed, the sentence may be reduced to six months of imprisonment; 

d) If imprisonment of at least three years or more is prescribed for a criminal offence, the sentence may be reduced to one year of imprisonment. 

e) If imprisonment for at least eight or more years is prescribed for a criminal offence, the sentence may be reduced to three years of imprisonment. 

#### Art. 43: Remission of Punishment

1) The court is obligated to remit the perpetrator of the punishment for a committed criminal offence when expressly provided by this Law. 

2) The court may remit the perpetrator of the punishment when this Law provides for such a possibility. 

3) When the Law provides for the possibility of remission of punishment, the court may impose a more lenient sentence, and in doing so, it is not obligated to adhere to the limits prescribed by this Law. 

#### Art. 44: Special Cased othe Remission of Punishment for Criminal Offenses Commited by Negligence

The court may remit the perpetrator of the punishment if he commits a criminal offense by negligence in the following cases: 

a) if the consequences of the criminal offense affect the perpetrator so severely that the punishment is unnecessary to achieve its purpose, or 

b) if, immediately after the perpetration, the perpetrator makes efforts to eliminate or reduce the consequences of the offense and if he completely or substantially compensates for the damage caused by the offense. 

#### Art. 45: Concurrently Adjudicated Criminal Offences

1) If the perpetrator, by one or more acts, commits several criminal offences adjudicated at the same time, the court shall assess the punishment under this Law and shall then pronounce an aggregate sentence for all these offences. 

2) The court shall pronounce an aggregate sentence according to the following rules: 

a) if for a concurrently adjudicated criminal offence, the court assesses a life sentence, it shall be the only sentence pronounced, 

b) if for concurrently adjudicated criminal offences, the court assesses imprisonment, the aggregate sentence of imprisonment must be longer than any individual sentence assessed but shall neither reach the sum total of the individual nor exceed twenty years of imprisonment, 

c) If the court assesses imprisonment of more than ten years for two or more concurrently adjudicated criminal offences, it shall pronounce an aggregate sentence of imprisonment of twenty years or a life sentence. 

d) if for each concurrently adjudicated criminal offence, imprisonment of a maximum of three years is prescribed, the aggregate sentence shall not exceed eight years of imprisonment,

#### Art. 46: Criminal Offense Arising Out of the Same Transaction

1) The provisions of this Code regarding concurrently adjudicated criminal offenses shall not apply to a criminal offense arising out of the same transaction. 

2) A criminal offense arises out of the same transaction when the perpetrator intentionally commits a number of identical unlawful acts or unlawful acts of the same type against the same injured person in which the manner of perpetration, the temporal connection and other material circumstances connecting them constitute a whole. 

3) When a criminal offense arising out of the same transaction comprises offenses of the same statutory description, the court shall choose the type and the range of the sentence prescribed for such a criminal offense. If criminal offenses of the same type are at issue, the court shall choose the type and the range of sentence prescribed for the most serious of these offenses. 

#### Art. 47: Selection of the Type and Range of Sentence for a Convicted Person

1) When a convict is tried for a criminal offence committed before beginning to serve a sentence as a result of a previous conviction or for a criminal offence committed while serving imprisonment, long-term imprisonment or juvenile imprisonment, the court shall pronounce an aggregate sentence for all criminal offences, applying the provisions of this Law, taking the previously assessed sentence as already fixed.

3) A suspended sentence may be applied to the perpetrator of a criminal offense for which the statute prescribes the imprisonment of up to five years and for criminal offenses for which the imprisonment of up to ten years is prescribed, if the provisions of mitigation of the punishment have been applied.

4) When the court does not revoke a suspended sentence (paragraph 2), it may for the new criminal offense impose a punishment or a suspended sentence. If it imposes a suspended sentence, both the previously pronounced and the newly pronounced punishment shall be treated pursuant to the provisions of this Code on the assessment of punishment for the concurrently adjudicated offenses, but a new term within which such an aggregate punishment will be suspended shall be determined. 

5) The court shall revoke a suspended sentence and order the execution of the pronounced punishment if the convicted person, within the course of the probation period, does not fulfill the obligations imposed on him in cases where he could have fulfilled them. In the case of the impossibility of fulfilling the obligations, the court may replace such obligations with others, or relieve the convicted person of the obligations. 

6) The court shall revoke a suspended sentence when, after its imposition, it finds that the person under a suspended sentence has previously committed a criminal offense, if it deems that the conditions required for the application of a non-custodial measure would not have existed had this criminal offense been known. Both the pronounced punishment in the case of revocation of a suspended sentence and the punishment for the previously committed criminal offense shall be treated pursuant to the provision of paragraph 3 of this Article. If the court does not revoke a suspended sentence, it shall act pursuant to the provision of paragraph 4 of this Article. 

7) Regardless of the reasons for revocation, a suspended sentence may not be revoked after a period of two years has elapsed. 

#### Art. 55: A Suspended Sentence with Supervision

1) When the conditions to impose a suspended sentence exist but the circumstances in which the perpetrator lives and his personality suggest that he needs assistance, protection or supervision in order to fulfill the obligation not to commit another criminal offense within the period of probation, the court may impose a suspended sentence with supervision. 

2) The supervision shall be performed by experts of a governmental body responsible for the execution of criminal sanctions. 

3) The supervision may last throughout the period of probation, but may also, by court order, be canceled sooner if the requirements for assistance, protection and supervision have ceased to exist.
