# Terms & Conditions for Company Registration
## Preface
This document contains and codifies the Terms and Conditions to Liberland’s services regarding the setting up, the registration, the business life, and the termination of companies in Liberland and also the Company itself, understood in the broadest possible sense, henceforth “Company services.” 

The purpose of this document is to prevent misunderstandings and manage certain expectations that Liberland, Liberland Limited, and other affiliated entities and persons, hereafter the “Provider,” might not be able to fully satisfy regarding the functions and consequences that are usually understood as part of company registration in extant states. 

These Terms and Conditions are temporary and shall be in force only until such a time as Liberland gains, in form or fact, the recognition of a significant part of the community of nations which will enable it to resume the regular duties one might expect of a State and declares these Terms and Conditions to have been revoked in part or whole.

Rest assured that we are doing all that is in our power to hasten the day this document will be relegated to the history archives.

You understand that we can not guarantee or warrant that files available for downloading from the internet or the Company Services will be free of viruses or other destructive code.

### Article 7: Use at your own risk
Your use of the Company Services, their content, and any services or items obtained through the Company Services is at your own risk.

#### § 1: Limitation of Provider Liability
1) You agree to hold the Provider, Liberland, affiliated entities and companies and all their officers, employees, contractors, partners, etc. completely harmless from and against any of your rights, their responsibilities, any claims, liabilities, including criminal liability, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of the non-recognition of Liberland Companies and Company services. 
2) The same applies whenever you attempt to use your Company for other than demonstration purposes or that you use it elsewhere than in Liberland or otherwise than solely towards other Liberlanders who partake in Company services.

#### § 2: No Liability in Case of Acts of Higher Power or Attacks
We will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack, viruses, or other technologically harmful material that may infect your computer equipment, computer programs, data, or other proprietary material due to your use of the websites or any services or items obtained through the websites or to your downloading of any material posted on it, or any websites linked to it.

### Article 9: Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Provider, its affiliates, licensors, and service providers, and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, licensors, suppliers, successors, and assigns from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to your violation of these terms and conditions or your use of the Company Services, including, but not limited to, any use of the Company Services, websites, content, services, and products other than as expressly authorized in these terms and conditions or your use of any information obtained from the Company Services.

### Article 10: Ownership of Liberland Companies
1) The Provider assists the participant in Company services in setting up and maintaining their Liberland Companies, but those companies are the sole ownership and the sole responsibility of their Owner or Owners. 
2) You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Provider for any responsibility, claims, liabilities, including criminal liability, damages, judgments, awards, losses, costs, expenses, or fees (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of a Liberland Company within or outside of Liberland.

### Article 11: Non-recognition of Liberland Companies and of Company services
1) In addition to what you acknowledged in the E-residency Terms and Conditions, you also acknowledge the lack of recognition of the Company service, particularly of individual Liberland Companies, in countries other than Liberland.  
2) You understand that any use of the Company Services with respect to any third country element is your responsibility and that you should not expect any degree of recognition towards the Company or the Company services by them. You are also solely responsible for all the consequences that may come out of such use.

### Article 12: Companies for a demonstration propose
1) You acknowledge that Liberland Companies are meant to be real and functioning Companies, but as Liberland is currently unable to provide, legally or otherwise, in part or absolutely, the normal guarantees, infrastructure and international recognition that the functions of this Company registry would require, there is currently a risk associated with the use of the Company and that risk is entirely the Principal’s, Shareholder’s, or of the owner of any rights towards the Liberland Company and any beneficial owner thereof. 
2) You agree not to expect any recognition, validity, or effect of your Companies in real commerce from anyone.

### Article 13: Domestic use only
1) In addition to all the above, Liberland only allows you to use the Company Services and Liberland Companies on Liberland’s soil and towards other partakers of those services. You agree and understand that if you should use those services or use your Company outside of these limitations, you are doing so outside their initially contemplated scope. 
2) Therefore, such use waivers all the national warranties that may apply and are fully and completely at your responsibility and risk. Likewise, you are solely responsible for all of its consequences to you or third parties.

### Article 14: Dispute resolution
All matters relating to the Websites and these terms and conditions and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of Liberland without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. 

### Article 15: Obligatory arbitration
1) Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, these terms and conditions or the Websites shall be instituted exclusively in Arbitration, and the forum for this Arbitration shall be Liberland and its judiciary system.
2) Liberland retains the right to bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of these terms and conditions in your country of residence or any other relevant country. You waive any and all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by such courts and to the venue in such courts.

### Article 16: No waiver; severability
1) No waiver by the Provider of any term or condition set forth in these terms and conditions shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or condition or a waiver of any other term or condition, and any failure of the Foundation to assert a right or provision under these terms and conditions shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
2) If any provision of these terms and conditions is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be eliminated or limited to the minimum extent such that the remaining provisions of the terms and conditions will continue in full force and effect.

### Article 17: Entire agreement
1) These Terms and Conditions constitute along with our Privacy policy sole and entire agreement between you and the Provider with respect to the Company Services and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to the Company Services.
2) With respect to specific services as are understood under Company Services, the Provider reserves the right to set up specific Terms and Conditions. These Terms and Conditions do supersede the current Terms and Conditions where they differ from them, but the current Terms and Conditions still apply where the service-specific Terms and Conditions should stay silent.
