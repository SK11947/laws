# Company Law

## Preliminary

This Law shall govern the Status of Companies and other entities possessed of legal personality apart from those of their Owners in Liberland, their Incorporation, their Legal Form and their Transfer and Dissolution.

## Definitions

**Articles of Incorporation** shall be the Company's founding document, describing its core bylaws, functions, institutions, operations, and purpose.

**Bylaws** are rules that the Shareholders of a Company agree upon that govern the operations of the Company, especially towards themselves and towards third persons.

**Capital** shall be wealth in the form of money or other Assets, such as the promises of Persons to regularly perform work owned by a person or organization or available for a purpose such as starting a company or investing. In the sense of this Law, Capital shall be held by a Company or another entity with Legal Personality and shall constitute its operating assets and the means by which it acts in the world. The sum of all Capital of a Company is its Total Registered Capital.

**Charitable Organization** shall be a legal person, domestic or foreign, the main or the only purpose of which shall be to serve as a charity, mutual aid or conservation organization.

**Company** is an association of Persons and Capital formed by Persons or by other Companies for the purpose of business or another kind of undertaking.

**Cooperative** is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic, social, and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly-owned enterprise.

**Corporate Governance** is how the Founders and the Shareholders decide the Company should be managed. Corporate Governance consists of the Persons acting in the capacity of Corporate Governance, the rules by which they are bound, and the processes they must follow. They might work in that capacity themselves or hire professionals who are not the Company's Owners.

**Company Name** is the primary name of the Company, which uniquely identifies it and under which it is registered in the Company Registry. There shall be not more than one Company Name to one Company, and no two Companies shall have the same Company Name.

**Creditors** shall be the persons or entities to which an entity is a due debt or other obligation.

**E-Residency** is a status where one undergoes the Know Your Customer (KYC) process and commits certain resources to gain access to Liberland Company Services, including the ability to Found, Own and be the Ultimate Beneficiary Owner or the Shareholder of a Liberland Company.

**Foundation** is an organisation that does not aim to make a profit. The money raised by a foundation consists of donations, loans, subsidies and legacies. Its primarily purpose is to support a social or non-profit cause. It may also be a business, but its profits must be allocated to the foundation's cause or purpose.

**Legal Personality** means that the Law of Liberland and the State Courts of Liberland treat a fictitious entity as if it was a real person of a specific type, as defined in this Law.  Given that this entity is not "real" in the sense of the natural world, it can't make decisions on its own and, therefore, must have owners and (ultimately) Ultimate Beneficiary Owners (i.e. Natural Persons) who decide in its stead.  This is a sharp distinction from the obligatory self-ownership of Natural Persons, who may not be owned in Liberland by anyone else but by themselves.

**Owners** are, for this Law, the Persons or entities who have property in an entity possessed of Legal Personality.

**Founder** shall be a Person or another entity which approaches the Company Registry.

**Incorporation** is the process prescribed by this Law whereby an entity gains Legal Personality apart from that of its owners.

**Principal** shall be a Person or entity designated according to the Articles of Incorporation to represent a Company in matters of regular management and act in its name towards third persons. Together or apart where stipulated in the Articles of Incorporation, the Principal form the Statutory Organ of the Company.

**Person** means a human being or another entity possessed of Legal Personality in Liberland. A human being shall also be known as a Natural Person.

**Registrar of Companies** is an Agency under the Ministry of Interior designated to operate, set up and maintain the Liberland Company Registry; an information system used to record Liberland Companies and other entities possessed of Legal Personality other than those of their Owners.

**Registered Office** is the address under which the Company stands registered in the Company Registry. It must be, in fact, reachable at that given address.

**Trade Name** is one of the names by which a Company presents itself. Trade Names shall be registered in the Company Registry for transparency's sake.

**Ultra Vires** is where a person of whom the third person may rationally assume that they act in the name of a Company either has no right to perform the given act or acts beyond their mandate from the Company.

**Ultimate Beneficiary Owner (UBO)** shall be the owner or the person who is effectively in control of an organization. Who is a UBO of a company shall be determined using internationally accepted standards and is in itself beyond the scope of this Law.

**Shares** are the proportional division of the ownership of a company. Shares are denominated in a currency and are fungible, but there could be different types of shares as defined in the Articles of Incorporation.

**Shareholder** is a person or an entity holding Shares of a Company or another entity possessed of legal Personality apart from its Owners.

In addition to the above, this Law uses terms defined in the Constitution, such as Liberland, Property, Citizenship, Law or Administration.

## Section 1: Legal Personality

#### Art. 1 Legal Personality

§ 1

Liberland shall have the power to grant to certain entities that are not Natural Persons a Legal Personality of their own apart of the Legal Personality of their Owners or Founders. This power shall be exclusive and reserved for the State of Liberland within Liberland's jurisdiction.&#x20;

§ 2

1. All entities to which Liberland grants a Legal Personality apart from their owners shall be written in the Registry as prescribed by this Law.&#x20;
2. A Liberland entity not written in the Registry or not written according to the process prescribed by this Law shall not possess a Legal Personality apart from its owners.

§ 3

Where a Law speaks of Persons, it shall also mean Legal Persons, unless it speaks of Natural Persons specifically or unless it is otherwise clear from the text that other than Natural Persons should be excluded.

#### Art. 2: Ownership

Unlike Natural Persons, an entity possessed of a Legal Personality shall be owned by other Persons or other entities who shall, in fact, make decisions for the entity. This shall not be interpreted as slavery but as a necessity, as these Legal Persons lack a natural will and ability to make decisions for themselves.

#### Art. 3: Resctriction on Form

Given that the granting of Legal Personhood to an entity which is not a Natural Person is an act that doesn't correspond to nature, Liberland shall restrict this by Law.

#### Art. 4: Foreign Entities Posessed of Legal Personality

§ 1

1. Liberland shall acknowledge the existence of similar entities incorporated in other States by similar means, where this incorporation or the existence of the entity is neither illegal nor immoral.&#x20;
2. There shall be a presumption of their Legal Personality made contingent to the correctness of their incorporation and of their registration in their home country.&#x20;

§ 2

There shall be no mandate to register these foreign entities in the Registry of Liberland, unless they choose to do so or unless they incorporate as a Liberland entity.

§ 3

The Administration and, in particular, the Judiciary shall interpret the properties of those foreign entities analogically according to this Law.

#### Art. 5: Mandatory Incorporation

1. For an entity that is not a Natural Person to be granted the privilege of a Legal Personality by Liberland, the Founders must incorporate the entity using the process described in this Law. The entity shall acquire its Legal Personality in Liberland upon its Incorporation.
2. Upon completing the Incorporation, the Founders become the first Owners of the new Legal Person.

#### Art. 6: Subsidiary Use of the Company

Where the Founders do not choose the entity's form, the Incorporation shall result in their entity becoming a Company. What applies to Companies in this Law shall also apply to other entities with Legal Personality as described in this Law, unless the specific provisions regarding those entities stipulate to the contrary.
