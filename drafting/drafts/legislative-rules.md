# Legislative Rules of Liberland

## Preface
## Preface
This Law establishes the obligatory standards for the formulation of legislation in the Republic of Liberland. The Law provides explicit regulations pertaining to the interpretation, language use, terminology, and structural format that legislative drafters must comply with. 

In the interest of systematic consistency and clarity, this Act delineates a binding framework for the organization of laws into articles and paragraphs. This structure is intended to promote coherence, facilitate comprehension, and provide an easy reference for legislative authorities and the public alike.

Furthermore, the Law introduces an enumerated list of technical terms or "terms of art" pertaining to lawmaking in Liberland. This provision is designed to ensure a uniform understanding of legal language and concepts within the legislative environment, thereby advancing clear communication and reducing the potential for misinterpretation.

By standardizing the drafting process, the Act contributes to the overall transparency, predictability, and legitimacy of the legislative process in the Republic of Liberland. Consequently, it serves the larger objective of strengthening the rule of law and democratic governance in the Republic.

## Section I: Linguistic Elements and Articulation Style

### Article 1: Official Language
All legislative texts pertaining to the jurisdiction of Liberland shall be scripted in the recognized dialect of Liberlandish, a variant of English prevalent and comprehensible within the confines of Liberland.

### Article 2: Articulation Style
Legislative authorities in Liberland shall maintain a formal and professional modus operandi of communication. Notwithstanding this formality, the language utilized shall retain clarity and comprehensibility for the general populace, rather than being restricted to professional comprehension.

### Article 3: Terminology Usage
#### ยง 1 Interpretation of Legal Terms
The terminology applied shall consistently be interpreted within the context of commonly accepted meanings. Technical terms borrowed from scientific or other academic disciplines shall be interpreted within their respective contexts. Such terms accepted from common parlance or from academia, etc. shall not be capitalized.

#### ยง 2 Legislative Definitions
1. In instances where it becomes imperative to deviate from the universally accepted interpretation of a term, the legislative authority shall employ a "Legislative Definition." This shall be initiated by the term "henceforth," or by an equivalent word that unequivocally introduces a new definition. Subsequently, the term being defined shall be capitalized in its entirety, e.g., "Legislative Definition."
2. All terms defined for the purpose of legislative comprehension within the Constitution and Laws of Liberland shall be cataloged in Appendix A of this Legislation.
3. Legislators drafting Regulations other than the Constitution or Laws, are not permitted to define terminologies by means of a Legislative Definition beyond what is already defined in the Constitution and the Laws.
