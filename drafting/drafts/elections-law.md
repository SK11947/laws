#### § 2: Ensuring Representativeness

If their first-choice candidate fails to secure the vote, their vote will be reassigned to their second-choice candidate, and so forth. The maximum number of candidates will be limited to maintain system logic.

### Article 9: Verification

#### § 1: Legitimacy Assurance
