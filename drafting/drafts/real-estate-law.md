## Section 1: Real Estate

### Art. 1: Real Estate

This Law governs the ownership, development, destruction, and preservation of Real Estate, comprising:

a) land within Liberland's State jurisdiction; and

b) any other property built on the land or connected to it in ways that preclude separation without excessive costs.

### Art. 2: Purpose of the Law

The purpose of this Law is to:

a) protect land and facilitate its regular development; and

b) regulate ownership rights to Real Estate, making this area of human activity transparent and accessible to non-experts.

### Art. 3: Superficies Solo Coedit

Unless the owner specifies otherwise, the landowner or other rights holder shall also be the owner or holder of these other rights towards the immovable property built on that land or permanently connected to it.

## Section 2: Real Estate Rights

### Art. 3: Real Estate Rights

#### § 1: Typology of Real Estate Rights

Real Estate Rights pertain to one or more pieces of Real Estate and include:

a) Real Rights, which attach to the given Real Estate and remain with it, even when ownership changes; and

b) Personal Rights, which attach to the given owner and do not remain with the Real Estate when ownership changes.

#### § 2: Demonstrative Nature of Rights Enumerated in This Law

The list of rights in this Law is demonstrative. Owners can create their own rights, which, if similar to a Real Right or a Personal Right, shall retain the nature of the right most closely resembling it.

### Art. 4: Ownership

Ownership refers to the full property rights to a given piece of Real Estate. Ownership in Real Estate is equivalent to ownership of any other property, but its transfer is limited to the forms permitted in this Law.

### Art. 5: Use

Use entails the ability to inhabit or otherwise utilize the property, any of its parts, or functions. The Use in question can be full, or the Owner can divide the property and allocate the Uses to different individuals.

### Art. 6: Pledge

1. Pledge places a possessory title on the Real Estate owned by a debtor and serves as collateral for another debt to a creditor. If the debtor cannot repay the original debt, the creditor may demand the sale of the Pledged Real Estate to repay the debt.

2. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, the creditor bears the risk of selling the Pledged Real Estate. A successful sale under reasonable market conditions and circumstances replaces the debt repayment, even if the sale proceeds do not cover the debt's nominal value. If the proceeds exceed the debt's nominal value, the debtor retains the surplus.

### Art. 7: Usufruct

Usufruct is the right granted by the owner to the tenant, typically for regular payment, to use and enjoy another's property without destroying or wasting its substance. The tenant retains any produce reasonably obtained through the property's use.

### Art. 8: Mortgage

A Mortgage is an agreement between a Real Estate owner or prospective buyer and a lender, concerning a loan that grants the lender the right to seize the property if the debtor fails to repay the loan.

### Art. 9: Habitation

1. Habitation is the right granted by the Owner to a tenant to regularly inhabit a piece of Real Estate, typically a home or living space. Unless further stipulated, the tenant may inhabit the premises with their immediate family, but not with pets, and is prohibited from bringing harmful substances.

2. A Habitation exchanged for counter payment is referred to as a Lease.

### Art. 10: Predial Servitude

Predial Servitude is a perpetual real right in another's property (the servient estate), granting the dominant estate owner permanent, specific entitlements to use and enjoy the servient estate.

## Section 3: Mandatory Registration

### Art. 11: Mandatory Land Registration

#### § 1: Registration Mandate

1. All land and Real Estate built on it must be registered in the Liberland Land Registry, henceforth the "Land Registry".

2. The Land Registry serves as the authoritative source of truth regarding land ownership and immovable property in Liberland.

#### § 2: Parcels

1. Land in the Land Registry is divided into Parcels, distinct pieces of land treated as separate units. Each Real Estate, other than land, is assigned to one or more Parcels.

2. Owners may request the Registrar to split or merge two or more Parcels they own. The Registrar will either confirm their decision or provide reasons why the merging or splitting is detrimental to the Law's purposes.

3. The initial land division into Parcels is outlined in Annex II of this Law.

#### Art. 12: Registrar

The Liberland Registrar of Land, henceforth "the Registrar", is an agency under the Ministry of Interior responsible for establishing, managing, and operating Liberland's land registration and the Land Registry.
### Art. 13: Registered Information

#### § 1: Data in the Registry for Parcels

The Registrar shall maintain the following data for each Parcel in the Land Registry:

a) the parcel area, border descriptions, and graphical representations;

b) the Parcel's name; and

#### § 2: Actions of the Registrar Regarding Submission for Open Transfer

1. The Registrar may reject the submission only if acceptance would clearly jeopardize this Law's objectives or seriously infringe on others' life, liberty, or property.

2. If the Registrar receives evidence-backed proof of the Owner's continued use of this right seriously infringing others' life, liberty, or property, the Registrar will inform the Owner that they can no longer use this right and must report each rights transfer per this Law's provisions.

3. The Owner shall have one month to comply.

The Owner must retain tenant identities, contracts, payment receipts, and provide them upon request from a Court or the Registrar.
