# Government Information Law

## Preface
This Law lays down rules relating to the protection of persons with regard to the Government processing of personal data and other information and rules relating to the free movement of personal data. It also sets up rules for the Government obtaining and utilizing information technology as the means to process information, in particular means of electronic communication and means of obtaining such technology and related services. The law sets up the institutions responsible for the development, maintenance, utilization and support of those services. The law enshrines into Liberland's legal order the country's orientation towards free and open source software.
