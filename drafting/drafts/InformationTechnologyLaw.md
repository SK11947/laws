# Government Information Law

## Preamble
This Law establishes regulations for the protection of individuals regarding the Government's processing of personal data and other information, as well as regulations for the free movement of personal data. It also sets rules for the Government's acquisition and utilization of information technology, particularly electronic communication methods and means of obtaining such technology and related services. The Law creates institutions responsible for the development, maintenance, utilization, and support of these services. Additionally, the Law enshrines Liberland's orientation towards free and open-source software into its legal order.

#### § 2: Limitations on Data Processing Based on Consent

### Article 7: Constitutional and Legal License
1) Where the Constitution or a law sets up a government function the correct exercise of which according to the best available practices and technology requires information and data control, such shall be performed with maximal care with respect to anyone who could be affected by this processing, above and beyond the standard of care prescribed for the other lawful purposes.
