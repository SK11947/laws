## Preamble

This law outlines the essential requirements for a judicial process to be considered lawful and serves as the procedural foundation for the Supreme Court, state-funded lower courts, and private dispute resolution mechanisms within the territory of Liberland.

## Section 1: General Principles   

### Art. 1: Purpose  
The purpose of this law is to provide for the establishment, organization, and functioning of the judicial system in Liberland, ensuring that justice is accessible, effective, and impartial for all who seek it.

1. All laws, regulations, and judicial procedural rules shall be publicly available and accessible so that potential parties may familiarize themselves with the legal framework governing the judicial process.

Every party involved in a judicial process shall have the right to be represented by legal counsel of their choice or to self-represent, and courts shall provide reasonable accommodations to ensure that all parties can effectively participate in the proceedings.

### Art. 6: Judicial Independence and Impartiality  
The judiciary in Liberland shall be independent of the executive and legislative branches of government and shall be impartial in the exercise of its functions.
Judges shall be free from any external influence, inducement, pressure, threat, or interference, whether direct or indirect, in the performance of their duties.

### Art. 9: Language   

#### § 1: Liberlandish as the Default Process Language  
1. State courts shall communicate in Liberlandish, a dialect continuum of English, and parties are responsible for compliance. The judge may direct otherwise, but only if all parties jointly agree to use a language other than Liberlandish.
2. When a party requests the service of a translator and/or interpreter, the judge shall arrange that at the expense of the requesting party.

#### § 2: Protection of a Weaker Party  
When the protection of a weaker party, such as a party with a sensory impairment, requires interpretation or transcription to make the process understandable for that party, and the use of legal counsel is insufficient, or the party can prove that they have insufficient means to obtain such legal counsel, the judge shall waive the requirement for the party to cover the expenses for translation or interpretation services. Additionally, the judge shall make any necessary accommodations to allow the party to present their case reasonably.

### Art. 10: Civil process    
Civil process, a procedure concerning matters in private law between parties, shall be the standard form of the process before any Court.

### Art. 11: Criminal process    

#### § 1: Defining Criminal Process
Criminal process shall be between Liberland and a private party where the subject matter is alleged non-compliance with the legal system, and Liberland stands as the public accuser.

#### § 1: Special Rules for Criminal Process
Special procedural rules apply to criminal processes to protect the accused and ensure even higher standards of justice than the standard procedural rules.

#### § 3: State Monopoly on Criminal Process  
Only State courts shall possess the jurisdiction to decide on a Criminal process. Any contractual stipulations to the contrary shall be null and void.

### Art. 12: Disciplinary process    
A disciplinary process shall be where a Private Court adjudicates a case between itself or the community that organizes it, or any of its representatives, and a private party where the subject matter is alleged non-compliance with that community's rules, laws, or traditions of the Private Court. The special procedural rules apply to the Disciplinary process as if it were a Criminal Process.

### Art. 13: Private Courts and Alternative Dispute Resolution  
1. Private courts, arbitration, mediation, and other alternative dispute resolution mechanisms may be established and operated within the territory of Liberland, subject to the general principles and minimum requirements set forth in this law.

#### § 2: Partial Judges  
1. A judge who has a personal connection to one or more of the parties or the object of the case shall be deemed partial where that connection is judged sufficient to influence their decision-making.

3. A partial judge shall be replaced according to the rules of the court. Partiality in itself shall not be counted against the judge without it having led to unjust decisions or breaches of due process, or without it having been found in extenuating circumstances (i.e., the judge must have known that they were partial and not reported it).
4. A court or higher court, where applicable, shall re-examine a judicial decision made and a judicial process presided by a partial judge, regardless of the procedural stage at which impartiality has been established.

### Art. 18: Judicial Decisions

However, a written copy, signed and affirmed by the judge, shall always be made available at the judge's discretion or upon request by a party.

The Supreme Court may also attract open Cases where the Appeal process is underway.

§ 2

The Supreme Court will, as a rule, not take in Cases where the Verdict is older than ten years, except where it has good reasons to assume that the Case was resolved grossly unjust, with exceptionally high consequence for the Parties or for the system of justice in Liberland or for the interests of individual liberty.&#x20;

**Art. 49: Reopening the Case**

§ 1

1. Where a Case is taken in by the Supreme Court, he Court of Appeal puts together all the information in a detailed documentation and sends it without delay to the Supreme Court.&#x20;

§ 2

1. Upon receiving the information that the Supreme Court has decided to attract the Case to it, the Applicant may inform the Supreme Court that they do not wish to continue the process.

2. Where the Applicant stays silent for more than 8 working days or confirms in writ or in word that the Case may proceed, the Case is Reopened and the Supreme Court shall hear it.

The Applicant, after they had once staid silent or confirmed their consent with the proceedings before the Supreme Court, cannot take back nor alter their Application.

**Art. 50 Supreme court process**

§ 1

The Process before the Supreme Court resembles in all ways the Regular process, but the Justices of the Supreme Court may disregard any phase they see fit. They can also modify rules. If they decide to do so, they shall inform the Parties of it as they start the Proceedings.

§ 2

The Supreme court is free to admit or dismiss any new facts and evidences, even if these were known during the previous phases of the Process. In its verdict, the Supreme Court has a complete autonomy and may disregard anything from the previous process as it sees fit.

## Book 4: Private Courts

**Art. 51: Purpose of Private Courts**

§ 1

Like the Administration, Private Courts shall exist primarily to ensure that the rights according to the Book 1 of this Constitution, henceforth "Property Rights", shall be respected and efficiently protected under all circumstances, even when it is not in the owner's powers to provide this protection themselves.&#x20;

§ 2

Private Courts shall be free to set up other purposes for their existence and operation, such as the administration of justice, the promotion of fair treatment or the protection of the weak against the strong, provided that Private Courts always interpret those as ancillary to the safeguarding of Property Rights.

§ 1

Every person or other entity in Liberland shall be under the jurisdiction of State courts unless they enter a contract with a Private Court.

§ 2

1. In processes over delicts, the State shall have the option to enforce the jurisdiction of State courts and neglect any contract between the party and a Private Court, where it is likely that a Private Court would not resolve the case justly or according to the Purpose as stated in Art. 1 of this Constitutional Amendment.
2. Regardless of any contractual obligations to the contrary, private courts shall not have jurisdiction regarding delicts where the guilty party would pay more than 5 BTC in damages or as punishment.

**Art. 53: Private Courts and the Constitution**

§ 1

Book 1 and the Book 3 of this Constitution shall be binding upon any Private Courts as if the Private Court was the Administration.

1.

**Art. 54: Minimal standards**

Private Courts shall ensure that the substantive law according to which they dispense their justice, or other such rules like tradition, jurisprudence, and international arbitration rules, shall be presented and made public in advance.&#x20;

A Private Court shall always consider Liberland State Courts' verdicts valid and likewise shall recognise other Private Courts' decisions, even if those come from different communities with conflicting rules or traditions.

**Art. 56: Hierarchy**

All Private Courts shall recognise the Supreme Court as the ultimate instance of appeal in Liberland. The jurisprudence of the Supreme Court shall be binding upon the Private Courts as it is upon any State Court, and they shall not make decisions contrary to it.

§ 1

Any verdict made by a Private Court in violation of the provisions of this Law shall be considered invalid.

§ 2

The State shall disestablish any Private Court repeatedly found in breach of the provisions of this Constitutional Amendment and any Law that may expand upon it that is found unwilling or unable to rectify the situation.
