## Preamble

## Definitions

## Section 1: Administrative process

### Article 1: Purpose of the Administrative Process

#### § 1: Definition and Scope
Administrative Process shall be the standardized procedural rules that govern the actions of the Executive bodies within Liberland. These rules are designed to ensure the systematic execution of responsibilities, thereby promoting public administration's effective and accountable functioning.

#### § 2: Governing Principles
The principles of fairness, transparency, and due process shall govern the Administrative Process. It shall be designed and executed to safeguard the rights of individuals and entities, reinforcing the integrity and accountability of public administration within Liberland.

### Article 2: Mandatory Steps in an Administrative Process

#### § 1: Progression of Actions
The General Administrative Process comprises a sequence of orderly actions, beginning with the submission of an application or request. This is followed by a review and evaluation by the competent authority, leading to the issuance of a decision.

#### § 2: Forms of the Administrative Process
1. The General Administrative Process shall serve as the standard form of the Administrative Process. 
2. In particular cases where the unique nature of a process before a specific administrative organ necessitates a different approach, such variations shall be outlined by this Law or by another dedicated law pertaining to that process. Where such a law does not provide guidance, the provisions of this Law and of the General Administrative Process outlined therein shall apply. 
2. Notwithstanding any special provisions, the principles governing the Administrative Process as defined in this Law shall remain in effect.

#### § 3: Appeal Mechanism
In all instances, the Administrative Process shall provide a mechanism for appeal, ensuring that decisions can be reviewed and, if necessary, revised.

### Article 3: Applicability of this Law

#### § 1: Universal Applicability
1. This Law shall preside over the actions of all bodies of the Executive without exception. Furthermore, it shall apply to the actions of all other public bodies within Liberland, provided its application is reasonably feasible.
2. Other entities, including private individuals and institutions, may voluntarily adopt the rules of the Administrative Process, thereby binding themselves to its provisions.
3. Any entity or body of any nature that applies the Administrative Process shall be referred to as an "Administrative Organ."

#### § 2: Unconditional Application of Principles
The principles delineated in this Law shall apply universally to all Administrative Organs and all public bodies, without exception.

### Article 4: Subsidiary Application of the Process Law
Where this or other Laws remain silent, the Process Law shall apply.

## Section 2: General Administrative Process
### Article 5: Initiation of the Administrative Process

#### § 1: Application-Driven Initiation
The Administrative Process shall commence upon the submission of an Application. The rules governing this Application shall be consistent with those applicable to an Application before a court.

#### § 2: Ex-Officio Initiation
In instances where a specific Law permits, the Administrative Organ may initiate the Administrative Process autonomously, exercising its own authority.

### Article 6: Participants in the Administrative Process

#### § 1: Mandatory Parties
1. The Administrative Process shall always involve the Administrative Organ's participation and at least one individual or institution. 

#### § 2: Additional Parties
In specific instances, as prescribed by this Law or other specific laws, additional subjects may become parties to the Administrative Process.

### Article 7: Designation of Responsible Officials
1. The Administrative Organ shall appoint one or, in situations of a special, dire need in order to safeguard the interests of the parties, more individuals as Responsible Officials. The Responsible Official or Officials shall undertake the process independently, executing their duties to the best of their abilities.
2. The Responsible Officials shall oversee the process in a manner akin to how a Judge presides over judicial proceedings.

### Article 8: Preference for Written Process
The Administrative Process shall predominantly be conducted in writing, employing as a rule asynchronous modes of communication.

### Article 9: Synchronous Proceedings
1. The Administrative Organ shall organize and hold synchronous proceedings when all parties, excluding the Administrative Organ, who are in a contradictory position towards each other, have collectively agreed to such a process.
2. Alternatively, synchronous proceedings shall be initiated upon the request of a weaker party to safeguard their interests. The Administrative Organ shall organize and hold synchronous proceedings when there is a clear and immediate need to uphold the fairness of the process. This provision shall apply even in instances where there is only one party in addition to the Administrative Organ, with the Administrative Organ being considered the stronger entity.

### Article 10: Conduct of Synchronous Proceedings
#### § 1: Administration of Proceedings
Synchronous proceedings shall be conducted before the Administrative Organ and shall be presided over by a Responsible Official. In instances where multiple Responsible Officials are appointed, all shall preside over the proceedings.

#### § 2: Rules Governing Proceedings
The conduct of Synchronous Proceedings shall adhere to the rules of the Trial as stipulated by the Process Law.

### Article 11: Procedural Standards for the Administrative Organ

### § 1: Adherence to Legal Principles and Factual Accuracy
The Administrative Organ is obligated to ensure that its conduct and resultant decisions are in strict compliance with the prevailing legal framework. Furthermore, the Administrative Organ shall only proceed with actions when it possesses a substantial degree of factual certainty. All actions must be predicated upon information that is both accurate and reliable.

### § 2: Duty of Investigation and Evidentiary Requirements
The Administrative Organ is mandated to conduct a comprehensive investigation pertaining to the case and must provide a clear and detailed reasoning for its actions. This reasoning must be based on the facts of the case and the applicable law. This includes the obligation to gather all necessary evidence and to resolve any existing ambiguities or uncertainties.

### § 3: Principle of Impartiality
The Administrative Organ is required to exercise absolute impartiality concerning the interests of all parties involved throughout the entire procedural process. Concurrently, it shall also function as a faithful representative of Liberland. In instances where these two obligations appear to conflict, the principle of impartiality shall take precedence.

### Article 12: Decision
### § 1: Purpose of the Decision
1. A decision shall be an individual act of the Administrative Organ, issued in writing, by which rights, legally protected interests or obligations are established, changed, abolished or determined, or by which a request or protest is rejected or dismissed.
2. A Decision shall be the conclusion of the Administrative Process, and it shall contain, in writing, the reasoning and shall refer to all the evidence used not only for the drafting of the decision, but also for all the actions that preceded it.

### § 2: Form of the Decision
1) A Decision shall be made in writing and shall be sent in an official copy to each party of the Administrative Process, as well as keeping a copy for itself. Its form shall be official and conducive to the readability and understandability of the content by the given party or by the general informed public in case of the official copy pertaining to the Arministrative Organ. 
2) A Decision shall contain the following information:

a) Identification of the Administrative Organ: The decision should clearly identify the administrative organ that is issuing the decision.
