#### Art. 7: Health Check
Any non-Citizen that applies for entry into Liberland must comply with immigration officers if asked to prove that they are not carrying a communicable disease

#### Art. 8: Public Health, Public Security, Public Policy, 
A non-Citizen shall only be allowed entry into Liberland if their entry won't incur a burden upon:  
a) Public Health, presenting a clear and present danger to others, or being a physical hindrance upon others or bringing an undue financial strain on the national economy,  
b) Public Security, where there is no clearly establihsed danger of the person becoming a danger to others and their Property, and  
c) Public Policy, where their entry would effect a psychological strain on the mental well-being of the public or damage the reputation of Liberland.   
An Immigration Officer First Class may derrogate from these demands in cases where the benefits to Liberland clearly outweight the dangers of the person's entry.
