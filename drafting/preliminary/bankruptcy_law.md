1. If a legal action, started by the bankrupt debtor, is still pending during bankruptcy, and this lawsuit regards their ownership in things, then the legal proceedings will be stayed upon the request of the defendant in order to give him the opportunity to summon the bankruptcy trustee, within a period to be set by court, to take over the proceedings.
2. If the bankruptcy trustee does not respond to such summons, the defendant has the right to request that the legal proceedings against him will be dismissed to the extend to which it entails the bankrupt debtor's ownership in things; failing such a request, the legal proceedings between the bankrupt debtor and the defendant may be continued, yet without any liability or disadvantage for the bankrupt debtor's estate.

2. By his appearance, the bankruptcy trustee will take over the legal proceedings as a result of which the bankrupt debtor is removed as a party from the proceedings by operation of law.
3. If the bankruptcy trustee, after his appearance, immediately acknowledges the legal claim of the plaintiff, the costs of proceedings of the opposing party shall not constitute an estate debt.
4. If the bankruptcy trustee does not appear in court, the provision of Article 25, paragraph 2, does not apply to a judgment to be obtained against the bankrupt debtor.

#### § 3: Legal proceedings started against the debtor and still pending on the day of the declaration of bankruptcy

To the extent that legal actions, pending at the moment of the declaration of bankruptcy, have as objective the performance of an obligation from the bankrupt debtor's estate, the legal proceedings shall be stayed after the bankruptcy order and will only be continued if verification of the claim is disputed. In such case the person disputing the verification will become a party to the proceedings instead of the bankrupt debtor.

#### § 1: Liquidation
In the event of bankruptcy, assets may be liquidated to repay creditors. The order of priority for repayment shall be determined by contractual agreement and failing that, by law.
