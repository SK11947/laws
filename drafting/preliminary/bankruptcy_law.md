### Article 5: Voluntary Bankruptcy**

#### § 1: Filing for Bankruptcy
A debtor may file for bankruptcy by submitting an application to the appropriate government agency.

#### § 2: Approval of Bankruptcy
The designated government agency shall review the bankruptcy application and approve it if the debtor meets the criteria defined by this law.

### Article 6: Involuntary Bankruptcy

#### § 1: Filing against a Debtor
A creditor or group of creditors may file for bankruptcy against a debtor who is insolvent and has failed to meet the terms of their debt agreements.

#### § 2: Approval of Bankruptcy
The designated government agency shall review the involuntary bankruptcy application and approve it if the creditor or creditors meet the criteria defined by this law.

### Article 7: Liquidation and Reorganization

#### § 1: Liquidation
In the event of bankruptcy, assets may be liquidated to repay creditors. The order of priority for repayment shall be determined by contractual agreement and failing that, by law.

#### § 2: Reorganization
In cases of corporate bankruptcy, a plan may be submitted to reorganize the business in an effort to become profitable again. This plan must be approved by a majority of creditors.

## Section 3: Bankruptcy Discharge

### Article 8: Discharge of Debts

Upon completion of bankruptcy proceedings, any remaining unsecured debts may be discharged, granting the debtor a 'fresh start'. Certain types of debts, such as those for child support or taxes, may not be dischargeable as determined by law.

### Article 9: Rejection of Discharge

A discharge may be denied if the debtor failed to complete a course in financial management, hid property to defraud creditors, or committed other forms of bankruptcy fraud.

### Article 10: Post-Discharge

Once the discharge is granted, the debtor is released from personal liability for the discharged debts. Creditors may not take any action to collect discharged debts from the debtor.

## Section 4: Rights of Creditors and Debtors

### Article 11: Rights of Creditors

#### § 1: Secured creditors
Secured creditors have a claim on the collateral pledged for their loan. They have the right to take possession of and sell the collateral if the debtor fails to repay the loan.

#### § 2: Unsecured creditors
Unsecured creditors do not have a claim on any particular asset of the debtor. In the case of liquidation, they are entitled to be repaid out of the general assets of the debtor after the claims of secured creditors have been satisfied.

### Article 12: Rights of Debtors

#### § 1: Exempt property
The debtor has the right to keep certain property, as specified by law, that is exempt from the claims of creditors. This could include, for example, a certain amount of equity in the debtor's primary residence, or certain personal items.

#### § 2: Fresh start
After the discharge of debts, the debtor has the right to a "fresh start." This means that the debtor is freed from the obligation to repay the debts that have been discharged, and creditors are prohibited from attempting to collect those debts.
