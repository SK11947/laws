1) Besides presenting itself as a Charitable Organization and not as a Company, the rules for establishing, dissolving and running a charitable organization shall be the same as those for a Company.

§ 2

A Charitable Organization without Shares or Shareholders shall have as its highest organ the Directorate, which shall be the meeting of all the members of its Statutory organ.

§ 3

1) A Charitable Organization does not need to have UBOs, as the beneficiaries of its operations are those in need or members of the general public, and not the owners.
