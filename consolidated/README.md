# Consolidated

Consolidated drafts have been largely finished and have gone through one or multiple rounds of recommendations. Recommendations have been worked in. The Consolidated drafts can be subject to further recommendations still before they are presented to the Cabinet. 

Regularly, the Minister of Justice presents draft laws to the Cabinet. When the Cabinet confirms the draft law by decision, they will become interim laws of Liberland.

When Congress becomes operational, the interim system will be put out of use. The Cabinet will still be confirming, rejecting or amending the draft, but this will not directly lead to them attaining legal force. 
Instead, the Cabinet will, through the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice or a minister responsible for the subject matter present those drafts as Cabinet Proposals to Congress. Congress will either adopt, reject or amend them.
