# In Force (Interim)

These are laws that are currently in force. Note that, due to the absence of a functioning Congress at this point, those laws are in force as "interim" laws.

When Congress becomes regularly operational, it will review these laws and, where needed, amend them. Then, it will either adopt or reject the (amended) new proposals, turning them into regular Liberland laws, according to the Constitution.
